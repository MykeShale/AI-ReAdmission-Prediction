✅ Part 4: Reflection & Workflow Diagram 
Reflection 
Q1: What was the most challenging part of the workflow? Why?
The most challenging part of the workflow was data preprocessing and feature engineering. Medical datasets, especially Electronic Health Records (EHRs), often contain missing values, inconsistent formats, and unstructured text like doctor's notes. Ensuring data quality, selecting relevant features, and maintaining privacy compliance (e.g., de-identifying patient data) required significant time, domain knowledge, and technical skill.

Q2: How would you improve your approach with more time/resources?
With more time and resources, I would:

Collaborate with domain experts (e.g., clinicians) to improve feature relevance and interpretability.

Use automated feature engineering tools (e.g., Featuretools) to speed up and scale the process.

Implement explainable AI (XAI) techniques (like SHAP or LIME) to better understand model decisions and build trust with healthcare providers.

Conduct more extensive hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to enhance model performance.
